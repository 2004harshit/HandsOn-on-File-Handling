    "\n",
    "1. **`w` Mode** (Write Mode)\n",
    "   - **Description**: Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, it is truncated (emptied). If it does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "   - **Usage**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "       file.write(\"Hello, World!\\n\")\n",
    "       file.write(\"This is a new file.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`a` Mode** (Append Mode)\n",
    "   - **Description**: Opens a file for appending. Data is written at the end of the file, preserving existing content. If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "   - **Usage**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:\n",
    "        file.write(\"\\nAppending new content.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`r+` Mode** (Read and Write Mode)\n",
    "   - **Description**: Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning. Writing will overwrite existing content starting from the beginning.\n",
    "   - **Usage**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r+') as file:\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "        print(\"Existing content:\")\n",
    "        print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "        file.seek(0)  # Move pointer to start\n",
